"""Fail on a CLAUDE.md or SKILL.md that has drifted into a dumping ground.

    check-claude-md.py [--max-lines 200]

Copied from the workflow plugin's justfile-conventions template
(LealSoftware/claude-plugins). Never edit it here: change it there and copy
it back. A repo with a reason for a bigger root file passes --max-lines.

For every tracked or new CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md:

- a CLAUDE.md over --max-lines (default 200, Anthropic's guidance) and a
  SKILL.md over 500. Every CLAUDE.md loads into a session that touches its
  directory, and length costs adherence, not just context. The fix is
  almost never trimming prose: move what one directory needs into that
  directory's CLAUDE.md, and a procedure into a skill.
- a TODO heading. Deferred work is a GitHub issue, which gets watched and
  closed; a TODO line in a file read every session goes stale silently.
- an @-import in a CLAUDE.md. Imports load eagerly at session start, so
  importing sharded files back undoes the sharding while the file still
  looks short. Refer to other docs by plain path instead.

Merges enquiries-service's claude-md-budget and server-playbook's
check_claude_md_size.py, which grew up separately.
